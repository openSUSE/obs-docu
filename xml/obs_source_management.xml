  <title>Find Package Sources</title>
  <para>
   OBS is adding information to each created package about the origin of the
   sources. This information is stored in the <command>DISTURL</command> tag of
   an rpm, which can be displayed as follows
<screen><command>rpm -q --queryformat '%{DISTURL}\n' glibc</command></screen>
<screen><command>rpm -q --queryformat '%{DISTURL}\n' -p glibc-2.1.0-1.i586.rpm</command></screen>
   The disturl can look like this:
   <command>obs://build.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Factory/standard/80d21fdd2299302358246d757b4d8c4f-glibc</command>
   It always starts with obs://. The second part is the name of the build
   instance, which usually also hosts the webui. Next comes the project name
   and the repository name where the binary got built. Last part is the source
   md5 sum and the package name.
  </para>
  <para>
   The disturl can also be entered in the search field of the web interface of
   the build service.
