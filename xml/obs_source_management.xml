    <para>OBS is adding informations to each created package about the origin
          of the sources. This information get stored in the <command>DISTURL</command>
          tag of an rpm, which can be displayed as followed
          <screen><command>rpm -q --queryformat '%{DISTURL}\n' glibc</command></screen>
          <screen><command>rpm -q --queryformat '%{DISTURL}\n' -p glibc-2.1.0-1.i586.rpm</command></screen>
          The disturl can look like this: <command>obs://build.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Factory/standard/80d21fdd2299302358246d757b4d8c4f-glibc</command>
          It always starts with obs://. The second part is the name of the build instance, which is usually also the webui.
          Next comes the project name and the repository name where the binary got built. Last part is the source md5 sum
          and the package name.
    </para>
