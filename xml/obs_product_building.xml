   <title>Product Line Setup</title>
   <para>
    Bigger products, like openSUSE or SUSE Linux Enterprise usually contain
    multiple media. These media must be kept in sync in various ways, for
    example for installation patterns, version numbering and other meta data.
    To guarantee this, OBS provides the product definition xml. Submitting such
    a product xml will create all necessary sources for meta packages and also
    all needed kiwi source files.

  <title>Release Management</title>
  <para>
   Products needs usually multiple approval steps and should only be released
   on manual approval. OBS is providing a mechanism which allows to copy
   sources and binaries to another project in this case. To use this the
   release target must be configured inside of a repository defintion of the
   project meta data:
<screen><command>&lt;project name="BuildProject"&gt;
  ...
  &lt;repository name="BuildRepo"&gt;
    &lt;releasetarget project="ReleaseProject" repository="ReleaseRepo" trigger="manual" /&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/repository&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
    </command></screen>
   The ReleaseProject must be create before and it should be configured as
   build disabled. The release can be triggered then via
<screen><command>osc release BuildProject</command></screen>
   All sources and build results will be copied over from BuildProject to the
   ReleaseProject and the publishing will happen afterwards. The operation will
   happen in background since it can take quite some time depending on the
   project size.
