   In case a user does not have commit permissions to a project, he can request
   to get maintainership permissions to this project. This makes sense if the
   user is already known to the project owners and they trust him as a
   maintainer. There is a way to do this via the request system of OBS, but
   only via osc so far:
<screen><command># osc createrequest -a add_me maintainer PROJECT</command></screen>

  <title>Contribute indirect to foreign projects</title>
  <para>
   Users who are new to a certain project, either because they are new users at
   all or don't have any deeper knowledge about this certain project don't have
   direct commit permissions. However, they can still create a copy of any
   package source and ask back to merge their changes. &obs; has support to
   make this easy.
