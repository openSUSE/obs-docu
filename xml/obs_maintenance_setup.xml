 <title>Maintenance Support</title>
 <para>
  This chapter explains the setup and workflow of an maintenance update in the
  openSUSE way. However, this should not be limited to openSUSE distribution
  projects but be usable anywhere (the entire workflow or just parts of it).
 </para>
 <para>
  The goal of the OBS maintenance process is to publish updates for a frozen
  project, in this example an entire distribution. These updates need to be
  approved by a maintenance team and the published result must contain
  documentation about the changes and be applicable in the easiest way by the
  users. The result is a package repository with additional informations about
  the solved problems and defined groups of packages to achieve that. Also
  binary delta data may get generated to reduce the needed download size for
  the clients.

  <para>
   This figure is giving a basic overview about the project setup and general
   workflow for a single package and single maintained distribution. It shows
   the "openSUSE:11.4" project, which is considered to be frozen and not
   changing at all anymore. The "openSUSE:11.4:Update" projects hosts all
   officially released updates. It does not build any binary, just gets it
   sources and binaries from the maintenance incident project via the release
   process. The incident project is named "openSUSE:Maintenance:IDxxx" in this
   example, which is under control of the maintenance team. Official updates
   get built and reviewed here. QA teams are also testing the binaries from
   here. However, a user can prepare it in the same way in his project and
   start the maintenance process via doing a "maintenance" request.

 <section>
  <title>How to use the maintenance process</title>
  <para>
   This describes all required steps by all involved persons from preparing to
   releasing a maintenance update.
  </para>
  <section>
   <title>Way A: A maintainer builds an entire update incident for submission</title>
   <para>
    A user is usually starting to prepare an update by creating a maintenance
    branch. This is typically done by creating an own maintenance project.
    Usually multiple released products are affected, so the server can find out
    which one are maintained by a given source package name, in this example
    for glibc including checkout via
   </para>
<screen><command>osc mbranch glibc</command>
<command>osc mbranch --checkout glibc</command></screen>
   <para>
    This is equivalent to the api call
    <command>/source?cmd=branch&amp;package=glibc</command>.
   </para>
   <para>
    It is also possible to branch only one defined version, if it is known that
    only one version is affected. In this example the openSUSE:12.1 version:
   </para>
<screen><command>osc branch --maintenance openSUSE:12.1 glibc</command>
<command>osc branch -M -c openSUSE:12.1 glibc</command></screen>
   <para>
    NOTE: both branch commands do support the --noaccess parameter, which will
    create a hidden project. This may be used when a not yet public known
    security shall get fixed.
   </para>
   <para>
    Afterwards the user needs to do the needed modifications. Packages will be
    built and can be tested. Afterwards he may add informations about the
    purpose of this maintenance update via
   </para>
<screen><command>osc patchinfo</command></screen>
   <para>
    If the source changes contain references to issue trackers (like bugzilla,
    CVE or FATE) these will be added to the _patchinfo file.
   </para>
   <para>
    The server will create a full maintenance channel now, in case the user
    wants to test this as well. After the user has tested, he has to create a
    maintenancerequest to ask the maintenance team to accept this as official
    update incident:
   </para>
<screen><command>osc maintenancerequest</command></screen>
   <para>
    On accepting this request all sources of the entire project will get copied
    to the incident project and be rebuild. The origin project gets usually
    removed (based on the request cleanup options).
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Way B: Submitting a package without branching</title>
   <para>
    You may submit a package source from a project which is not prepared as
    maintenance project. That works via the maintenancerequest mechanism by
    specifing one or more packages from one project. As a consequence it means
    also that the first testable build will happen in the maintenance incident
    project. Also the maintenance team need to write the update information on
    their own.
   </para>
   <para>
<screen><command>osc maintenancerequest [ SOURCEPROJECT [ SOURCEPACKAGES RELEASEPROJECT ] ]</command></screen>
   </para>
   <para>
    The following example is submitting two packages (kdelibs4 and kdebase4)
    from the project KDE:Devel project as update for openSUSE:12.1
<screen><command>osc maintenancerequest KDE:Devel kdelibs4 kdebase4 openSUSE:12.1</command></screen>
   </para>
   <para>
    NOTE: it is also possible to specify an existing incident as target via the
    --incident parameter. The packages will be merged into that existing
    incident project then.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Way C: Process gets initiated by the maintenance team</title>
   <para>
    The maintenance team may start the process (for example because a security
    issue was reported and the maintenance team decided that a fix is
    required). In this case the incident gets created via the webui or via the
    api call
   </para>
   <para>
    <command>osc createincident [PROJECT]</command>
   </para>
   <para>
    <command>osc api /source/PROJECT?cmd=createmaintenanceincident</command>
   </para>
   <para>
    <command>osc api
    /source?cmd=createmaintenanceincident&amp;attribute=OBS:Maintenance</command>.
   </para>
   <para>
    To document the expected work the creation of a patchinfo package is
    needed. This can be done via
   </para>
   <para>
    <command>osc patchinfo [PROJECT]</command>
   </para>
   <para>
    It is important to add bugzilla entries inside of the _patchinfo file. As
    long these are open bugzilla entries, the bug assignee will see this
    patchinfoi on his "my work" webui and osc views, so he knows that work is
    expected for him.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Maintenance Incident Processing</title>
   <para>
    The maintenance incidents are usually managed by a maintenance team. In
    case the incident got started by a maintainer a maintenance request is
    targeted towards the defined maintenance project, in our example this is
    openSUSE:Maintenance. The defined maintainer and reviewers in this project
    need to decide about this request. In case it gets accepted, the server is
    creating a subproject with a unique incident ID and copies the sources and
    build settings to it. The origin project will get removed usually via the
    cleanup option. This maintenance project is used to build the final
    packages.
   </para>
   <para>
    If the maintenance team decides to merge a new maintenance request with an
    existing incident, they can run the <command>osc rq setincident $REQUESTID
    $INCIDENT</command> before accepting the request.
   </para>
   <para>
    The maintenance team may still modify them or the patchinfo data at this
    point. An outside maintainer can still submit changes via standard submit
    request mechanism, but direct write permissions are not granted. When the
    maintenance people are satisfied with the update, they can create a request
    to release the sources and binaries to the final openSUSE:11.4:Update
    project.
   </para>
<screen><command>osc releaserequest</command></screen>
   <para>
    The release request needs to specify the source and target for each
    package. In case just the source package or project is specified the api is
    completing the request on creation time. It is using this based on the
    source link target of each package and the release information in the
    repository definitions.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Incident gets released</title>
   <para>
    The release process gets usually started via creating a release request.
    This sets all affected packages to the locked state, which means that all
    commands for editing the source or triggering rebuilds are not allowed
    anymore.
   </para>
   <para>
    The release request typically needs to be approved by QA and other teams as
    defined in the Update project. In case something gets declined, the
    necessary changes need to be submitted to the maintenance project and a new
    release request has to be created.
   </para>
   <para>
    A unique release ID will be generated and become part of the updateinfo.xml
    file in the target project on release event. This ID is different from the
    incident ID and is usually in the style of "YEAR-COUNTER". The counter is
    strictly increasing on each release. In case of a re-release of the same
    incident a release counter will be added.
   </para>
   <para>
    A different naming scheme can be defined via the OBS:MaintenanceIdTemplate
    attribute value. The release will move all packages to the update project
    and extend the target package name with the incident ID. Binaries will be
    moved as well without modification. The exception is the updateinfo.xml
    which will be modified by replacing its incident id with the release id.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Incident gets reopened and re-released</title>
   <para>
    An update should not, but may have an undetected regression. In this case
    the update needs a re-release. (If another problem shall be fixed a new
    incident should be created instead.)
   </para>
   <para>
    If the current update harms the systems, the maintenance team may decide to
    take it back immediatly. It can be done by removing the patchinfo.ID
    package container in the Update projects. This will create a new update
    channel without this update.
   </para>
   <para>
    To re-open a release incident project, it must get unlocked and marked as
    open again. Unlocking can be done either via revoking a release request or
    via explicit unlocking the incident. The explicit unlock via osc:
<screen><command>osc unlock INCIDENT_PROJECT</command></screen>
    is also triggering a rebuild to ensure to have higher release numbers and
    adding the "trigger=maintenance" flags to the release target definitions.
    Afterwards the project can be edited again and also gets listed as running
    incident again.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Using custom update IDs</title>
   <para>
    The used string of update IDs can be defined via the
    OBS:MaintenanceIdTemplate attribute value of the master maintenance
    project.

                Source revision links are using the xsrcmd5 to avoid that other
                releases will affect this package instance. TBD: how to raise the source revision to current version manually ?

    open requests either for creating or release an incident. Also the open
    incidents, which are not yet released are visible.
   </para>
   <para>
    All users need usually just to visit their "my work" screen in webui or osc

   <title>Defining a maintenance space</title>
   <para>
    An OBS server is using by default a maintenance space defined via the
    OBS:Maintenance attribute. This must get created on a project where
    maintenance incident projects should get created below. This project is
    also defining the default maintenance maintainers and reviewers in its acl
    list.
   </para>

    It is possible to have multiple and independent maintenance name spaces,
    however the maintenance request must be created against this other
    namespace manually or using a different attribute.

  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Maintained Project Setups</title>
   <para>
    Maintained projects must be frozen, this means no changes in sources or
    binaries. All updates will be hosted in the defined update project. This
    project gets defined via the OBS:UpdateProject attribute which must contain
    a value with the update project name. In addition to this, an attribute to
    define the active maintenance should also be defined, by default the
    OBS:Maintained attribute. The osc mbranch command will take packages from
    this project as a result.
   </para>
   <para>
    The Update project should be defined as build disabled as well. Also define
    a project link to the main project and at least one repository building
    against the main project.

  <title>Optional Channel Setup</title>
  <para>
   Channels are optional definitions to publish a sub-set of binaries into own
   repositories. They can be used to maintain a larger amount of packages in a
   central place, but defining to published binaries with an independent
   workflow which requires an approval for each binary.
  </para>
  <section>
   <title>Defining a channel</title>
   <para>
    Channels get defined and maintained in a xml file inside of a package
    source. The file name of these lists must be _channel.
   </para>
   <para>
    The file may contain a list of targets where binaries gets released to.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Using channels in maintenance workflow.</title>
   <para>
    Channel definitions for existing packages do affect incident projects.
    Matching channel packages get automatically branched inside and additional
    repositories for the channels are created. The server will build the
    channel package by aggregating the binary packages into the channel
    repositories.
   </para>
   <para>
    The _channel files can be modified inside of the the incident project if
    needed. This can be necessary when binary packages get renamed or added
    with this update. The modification will be part of the maintenance release
    request as simple submit actions.

   <para>
    This example shows the setup where selected binary packages get released
    also to a defined channel. The openSUSE:11.4:SecurityChannel project
    contains a _channel definition inside of the channel package. This one gets
    branched as well into the incident in case a matching channel does exist.
    Also the additional repository gets added. The resulting binaries will be
    transfer via a release request to the code stream project
    (openSUSE:11.4:Update) and the special channel project.
