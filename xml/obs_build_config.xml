<chapter id="cha.obs.build_config">
 <title>Build Configuration</title>
 <para>
  The build configuration is needed at least in each base project to define the
  setup of the build system. In addition to that it can be used to handle
  compatibility layers or to switch on or off certain features during the
  build.
 </para>
 <para>
  The build config is reachable via API /source/PROJECT/_config, via
  <command>osc meta prjconf</command> or via webui via Project Config tab.
 </para>
 <section>
  <title>Configuration File Syntax</title>
  <para>
   The build configuration is parsed by OBS in rpm style independent of the
   used packaging format. This means that you can use rpm features like macros
   or conditions in the configuration. All lines consist of the form 'keyword:
   arguments'.
  </para>
  <para>
   &lt;PACKAGES&gt; mean binary package provides, but not the full filename.
   For example gcc, but not gcc-1.2.3.i386.rpm. Provides of a package can not
   be used either.
  </para>
  <section>
   <title>Required: &lt;PACKAGES&gt;</title>
   <para>
    Required lines contain one or more packages that always get installed for
    package builds. A change in one of the requires packages triggers a new
    build.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Support: &lt;PACKAGES&gt;</title>
   <para>
    Support lines contain one or more packages which also get installed for
    package builds, but a change in one of the packages does not trigger an
    automatic rebuild. This is useful for packages that most likely do not
    influence the build result, for example 'make', or 'coreutils'.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Preinstall: &lt;PACKAGES&gt;</title>
   <para>
    Preinstall packages are needed to run the package installation program.
    They get unpacked before the VM gets started. Included scripts are NOT
    executed during this phase. However these packages will get installed again
    inside of the VM including script execution.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Keep: &lt;PACKAGES&gt;</title>
   <para>
    To eliminate build cycles the to-be-built package is not installed by
    default, even when it is required. Keep can be used overwrite this
    behaviour. It is usually needed for packages like 'make' that are used to
    build itself. Preinstalled packages are automatically kept, as the package
    installation program needs to work all the time.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>VMInstall: &lt;PACKAGES&gt;</title>
   <para>
    VMInstall is like Preinstall, but these packages get only installed when a
    virtual machine like XEN or KVM is used for building. Usually packages like
    'mount' are listed here.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Runscripts: &lt;PACKAGES&gt;</title>
   <para>
    Runscripts defines the scripts of preinstalled packages which needs to be
    executed directly after the preinstall phase, before installing the
    remaining packages.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Order: &lt;PACKAGE_A&gt;:&lt;PACKAGE_B&gt;</title>
   <para>
    The build script takes care about the installation order if they are
    defined via dependencies inside of the packages. However, there might be
    dependency loops (reported during setup of the build system) or missing
    dependencies. The Order statement can be used then to give a hint where to
    break the loop. &lt;PACKAGE_A&gt; will get installed before
    &lt;PACKAGE_B&gt;.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>ExportFilter: &lt;REGEXP&gt; &lt;ARCHITECTURES&gt;</title>
   <para>
    The export filter can be used to export build results from one architecture
    to others. This is required when one architecture needs packages from
    another architector for building. The regexp must match the resulting
    binary name of the package. It will export it to all listed scheduler
    architectures. Using a single dot will export it to the architecture which
    was used to build it. So not using a dot there will filter the package.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>PublishFilter: &lt;REGEXP&gt; [&lt;REGEXP&gt; [...]]</title>
   <para>
    The publish filter can be used limit the published binary packages in
    public repositories. Packages that match any &lt;REGEXP&gt; will not be put
    into the exported repository. There can be only one line of PublishFilter
    for historic reasons. However, multiple &lt;REGEXP&gt; can be given.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Prefer: &lt;PACKAGES&gt;</title>
   <para>
    In case multiple packages satisfy a dependency, the OBS system will
    complain about that situation. This is unlike like most package managing
    tools, which just pick one of the package. Because one of OBS' goal is to
    provide reproducible builds, it reports an error in this case instead of
    chosing a random package. The Prefer: tag lists packages to be preferred in
    case a choice exists. When the package name is prefixed with a dash, this
    is treated as a de-prefer.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Prefer: &lt;PACKAGE_A&gt;:&lt;PACKAGES&gt;</title>
   <para>
    It is possible to define the prefer only when one package is creating the
    choice error. This package must be listed first with a colon.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Ignore: &lt;PACKAGES&gt;</title>
   <para>
    Ignore can be used to break dependencies. This can be usefull to reduce the
    number of needed packages or to break cyclic dependencies. Be careful with
    this feature, as breaking dependencies can have surprising results.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Ignore: &lt;PACKAGE_A&gt;:&lt;PACKAGES&gt;</title>
   <para>
    It is possible to define the ignore only for one package. This package must
    be listed first with a colon.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>FileProvides: &lt;FILE&gt; &lt;PACKAGES&gt;</title>
   <para>
    OBS ignores dependendencies to files (instead of package names) by default.
    This is mostly done to reduce the amount of memory needed, as the package
    file lists take up a considerable amount of repository meta data. As a
    workaround, FileProvides can be used to tell the systems which packages
    contain a file. The File needs to have the full path.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Substitute: &lt;PACKAGE_A&gt; &lt;PACKAGES&gt;</title>
   <para>
    It is possible to replace to BuildRequires with other packages. This will
    have only an affect on directly BuildRequired packages, not on indirectly
    required packages.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>BuildFlags: &lt;FLAG&gt;:&lt;VALUE&gt;</title>
   <para>
    This defines flags for the build process. The following values for FLAG are
    usable.
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <simpara><parameter>vmfstype:</parameter> Defines a specific filesystem when building inside of a VM.
        </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara><parameter>kiwiprofile:</parameter> builds the selected profile in kiwi appliance builds.
        </simpara>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>BuildEngine: &lt;ENGINE&gt;</title>
   <para>
    Use an alternative build engine. This is still chained inside of the build
    script for security reasons. Alternatives are mock (for Fedora and RedHat)
    and debootstrap (for Debian). This will avoid differences in the build
    environment setup, but it will also have an effect on speed and reduced
    features. It should only be used when you want to emulate the distribution
    build. debbuild enginge will build deb files out of a spec file
    description. It can be used by the following definition inside of the
    projet build config:
<screen><command>
Repotype: debian
Type: spec
Binarytype: deb
BuildEngine: debbuild
Support: pax
Support: debbuild
Keep: debbuild
           </command></screen>
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>OptFlags: &lt;TARGET_ARCHITECTURE&gt; &lt;FLAGS&gt;</title>
   <para>
    rpm only: Optflags exports compiler flags to the build. They will only have
    an effect when the spec file is using $RPM_OPT_FLAGS. The target
    architecture may be * to affect all architectures.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Type: &lt;TYPE&gt;</title>
   <para>
    Build recepie type. This is the format of the file which provides the build
    description. This gets usually autodetected, but in some rare cases it can
    be set here to either one of these: spec, dsc, kiwi, livebuild, arch,
    preinstallimage
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>BinaryType: &lt;TYPE&gt;</title>
   <para>
    Binary type. This is the format of the files which will be the result of
    the build jobs. This gets usually set depending on the build recepie type.
    In some situations, for example a kiwi build job result gets converted into
    an rpm, it can be used to overwrite it. Possible values are: rpm, deb or
    none
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Target: &lt;TARGET_ARCHITECTURE&gt;</title>
   <para>
    rpm only: Defines the target architecture. This can be used to build for
    i686 on i586 schedulers for example.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>HostArch: &lt;HOST_ARCHITECTURE&gt;</title>
   <para>
    This is used for cross builds. It defines the host architecture used for
    building, while the scheduler architecture remains the target architecture.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>type: &lt;TYPE&gt;</title>
   <para>
    Defines the recipe format. Valid values are currently: none, spec, dsc,
    arch, kiwi, preinstallimage. If no type is specified, OBS deduces a type
    from the binary type.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Binarytype: &lt;TYPE&gt;</title>
   <para>
    (OBS 2.4 or later): Sets the binary format used to setup the build
    environment. For example a package with spec build description may use and
    generate deb packages instead of rpms. If no binary type is specifed, OBS
    deduces it from the recipe type. If the recipe type is also not set, OBS
    looks at the Preinstall package list for a hint.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Repotype: &lt;TYPE[:OPTIONS]&gt; ...</title>
   <para>
    Defines the repository format for pulished repositories. Valid values are:
    none, rpm-md, suse, debian, hdlist2, arch, staticlinks. The OPTIONS
    parameter depends on the repository type, for rpm-md the known options are
    'legacy' to create the old rpm-md format, 'deltainfo' or 'prestodelta' to
    create delta rpm packages, 'rsyncable' to use rsyncable gzip compression.
    To split the debug packages in an own published repository the option
    splitdebug:$REPOSIORY_SUFFIX can be used.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Patterntype: &lt;TYPES&gt;</title>
   <para>
    Defines the pattern format. Valid values are: none (default), ymp, comps.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Constraint: &lt;SELECTOR&gt; &lt;STRING&gt;</title>
   <para>
    (OBS 2.4 or later): Define build constraints for build jobs. The selector
    is a colon-separated list which gets a string assigned. Please see the
    build job constraints page for details.
   </para>
  </section>
 </section>
 <section>
  <title>Macro Section</title>
  <para>
   The macro section of the build configuration starts behind a Macros: line
   and is only used on rpm builds. The content gets exported to be used by
   rpmbuild during the build. It can be used to export a define using "%key
   value" lines.
  </para>
