  <title>OBS test run on Microsoft Windows using VMware player</title>
  <para> Those who are not familiar with Linux can run and test OBS. To run and
   test OBS in Windows, you could use a virtual machine program such as VMware
   or VirtualBox, etc. This chapter explains, how you can run OBS using VMware
   player. To check and test with VirtualBox or another virtual machine, check
   in below. </para>
  <para> After you are done installing VMware player on Windows, you need to
   download the OBS appliance program. You could get OBS appliance file by
   visiting <link xlink:href="http://openbuildservice.org/download/other/"
    /> and clicking on
    <guimenu>VirtualBox/VMware Image</guimenu>. After downloading,
   uncompress with some Windows archiving program that understands the
    <filename>.tar.bz2</filename> file format. </para>
  <para> Now, open VMware Player application and
   select <menuchoice>
    <guimenu>File</guimenu>
    <guimenu>Open a Virtual Machine</guimenu>
   </menuchoice>, or you could press <keycombo action="simul">
    <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
    <keycap>O</keycap>
   </keycombo> directly. Open the decompressed virtual machine in
    <guimenu>Open Virtual Machine</guimenu> dialog box. Click on
    <guimenu>Play virtual machine</guimenu> icon or hyper link in VMware
   player. </para>
  <para> At the Linux prompt, you can login using "root" as a login name and
   "opensuse" as a password. Now, OBS local instance should be already loaded
   and running in your system. To make sure that the OBS Web UI is successfully
   up and running, open the OBS Web UI. </para>
  <para> To access OBS Web user interface, open your web browser and try the
   address <uri>http://vm.ip.address</uri>. You can check the virtual
   machine's IP address by using <command>ifconfig</command> Linux command.
   Now, you probably could see a screen like the one below in your window: </para>
  <!-- fs 2011-10-13: Image missing
    <figure>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>
    -->
  <para> To login your local OBS instance, you could use default login name as
   "Admin" and password as "opensuse". Check if you could login properly by
   clicking <guimenu>Login</guimenu> on your local OBS instance Web UI.
  </para>

  <title>OBS 1 click install on openSUSE 13.1</title>
  <para> This section explains, how you can install OBS on top of openSUSE
   13.1. Open your web browser and go to that URL <link
    xlink:href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:/Tools/openSUSE_13.1/OBS_Server.ymp"
    >http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:/Tools/openSUSE_13.1/OBS_Server.ymp</link>
  </para>
  <para> This YaST Meta Package file lets you install OBS by 1 click. In case
   you are using openSUSE 11.2 or below version, check if you could find 1
   click install file in this URL <link
    xlink:href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Installation_SUSE"
    >http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Installation_SUSE</link>
  </para>
  <para> After you click on the above URL, you would see <guimenu>Opening
    OBS_Server.ymp</guimenu> window, Select default selection which is
    <guimenu>Open with YaST Meta Package Handler</guimenu> and press
    <guimenu>OK</guimenu> button. Then <guimenu>OBS_Server Installation -
    YaST</guimenu> window will appear. Select <guimenu>Next</guimenu>
   button after that till you get successful OBS setup message. </para>
  <para> TIPS : In case you didn't install libMagickCore.so.2 in openSUSE, you
   might face dependency warning. In that case, stop the OBS install by
   pressing <guimenu>Abort</guimenu> button in <guimenu>OBS_Server
    Installation - YaST</guimenu> window. Then search and install
   libMagickCore using a search engine like Google or others and repeat above
   processes. Then you will get an OBS setup message. </para>
  <para> Now, OBS Server is installed in your openSUSE. To run OBS server, you
   need to work on several further steps. Open
   /usr/share/doc/packages/obs-api/README.SETUP file. To run OBS server, you
   need to follow each step of README.SETUP carefully based on your system
   situation. You can also find this <filename>README.SETUP</filename> file in
   our public <link
    xlink:href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/blob/master/dist/README.SETUP.md"
    >git repository</link>. If you are using our stable release, you might want
   to switch to the corresponding branch, eg. <link
    xlink:href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/blob/2.7/dist/README.SETUP"
    >2.7</link>. </para>
  <para> If you follow instructions from README.SETUP file, you should be able
   to run OBS server in your system. There are several tips that I would like
   to comment regarding README.SETUP file. </para>
  <para> TIP #1 : Check <citetitle>3.1 Initialize fresh Database</citetitle>. It
   might be described as </para>
  <screen># cd /srv/www/obs/api/
# sudo RAILS_ENV="production" rake db:setup
# sudo chown lighttpd.lighttpd log/*

# cd /srv/www/obs/webui/
# sudo RAILS_ENV="production" rake db:setup
# sudo chown lighttpd.lighttpd log/*</screen>
  <para> but it should be </para>
  <screen># cd /srv/www/obs/api/
# sudo RAILS_ENV="production" rake db:migrate
# sudo chown lighttpd.lighttpd log/*

# cd /srv/www/obs/webui/
# sudo RAILS_ENV="production" rake db:migrate
# sudo chown lighttpd.lighttpd log/*</screen>
  <para> For more information, see <link
    xlink:href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Installation_SUSE"
   />. </para>
  <para> TIP #2 : If you get fail message because of "apisrv" in "6. Using osc
   with your local build service:", try apiurl instead. </para>
  <para> You might face some issues during process to follow README.SETUP file.
   If you read and follow instructions carefully, you could run OBS local
   instance on your system successfully. </para>

  <title>OBS 1 click install on SLES (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server) 12</title>
  <para> 1 click install for OBS in SLES12. This section explains how you
   install OBS in SLES12. Installation of OBS in SLES12 is quite similar to OBS
   install method on openSUSE. I would skip same contents so you might need to
   have a look for prior section "OBS 1 click install on openSUSE 13.1". </para>
  <para> Before you install OBS on SLES12, you need to download and install
   SLES12 SDK first. you could download SLES12 SDK in here <link
    xlink:href="http://download.novell.com">http://download.novell.com</link>. </para>
  <para> After you download and install SLES12 SDK, We could use YMP file for
   OBS 1 click install like openSUSE 13.1. Open your web browser and go to this
   URL <link
    xlink:href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:/Tools/SLE_11/OBS_Server.ymp"
    >http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:/Tools/SLE_11/OBS_Server.ymp</link>. </para>
  <para> Like for openSUSE 11.3, I have referenced the previous from <link
    xlink:href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Installation_SUSE"
    >http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Installation_SUSE</link>. </para>
  <para> After you clicked on that URL, you would see <guimenu>Opening
    OBS_Server.ymp</guimenu> window as described in the previous openSUSE 13.1
   section. Press <guimenu>OK</guimenu> button and
    <guimenu>Next</guimenu> button after YaST2 window pops up. If YaST lets
   you know successful install of OBS server, then you are ready to activate
   and run OBS on SLES12. </para>
  <para> To run OBS server on SLES12, you need to follow instructions based on
   /usr/share/doc/packages/obs-api/README.SETUP file as described in prior
   section. From here, you could refer to prior section for successful OBS run
   on your SLES12. </para>

  <title>Installing a readymade OBS appliance in a VirtualBox</title>
  <para> This method is slightly less easy than the method using the readymade
   vmdk VMware disk, but it enables you to determine the size of your virtual
   disks to your convenience. It could also work with a real computer with two
   disks. It requires some knowledge of command line and partitioning. </para>
  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para> Download the OBS appliance installer. Visit: <link
      xlink:href="http://www.openbuildservice.org/download"
      >http://www.openbuildservice.org/download</link> and press the
      <guimenu>Download the OBS Appliance Installer</guimenu> button. It
     will start downloading an ISO image. </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para> In VirtualBox, create a virtual machine with:</para> 
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para> 4 GB memory </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>

   <step>
    <para> Boot the virtual machine and choose to install the OBS server on the
     smaller virtual hard disk. </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para> Log into the virtual machine with Login: root and Password:
     opensuse. If needed, switch to German/French/whatever keyboard: <command>#
      loadkeys de</command>. Inspect partitioning: <command># df -h</command>.
     It shows you that the root partition is small and already almost full (1.6
     GB used out of 1.8). Let's prepare the other partitions to get a bit more
     working space. First, <command># fdisk /dev/sda</command> and prepare
      <filename>/dev/sda2</filename> to use the remaining space. Second,
      <command># fdisk /dev/sdb</command> and prepare
      <filename>/dev/sdb1</filename> to use all the space, with type 8e (Linux
     LVM): </para>
     <screen> # pvcreate /dev/sdb1
 # vgcreate OBS /dev/sdb1
 # lvcreate -n server -L 48G OBS
 # mkfs.ext4 /dev/OBS/server</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para> Reboot, this time onto the hard disk. The CD-ROM might be
     disconnected, we will not need it anymore. Log in as root user, change
     keyboard if needed, and format <filename>/dev/sda2</filename>: <command>#
      mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2</command>. Add following entry to /etc/fstab:</para>
     <screen>/dev/sda2  /var/cache/obs  ext4  defaults  2 1</screen> 
     <para>Mount the new partition: <command># mount /dev/sda2</command>. Get your IP
     address: <command># ifconfig</command>. </para>
