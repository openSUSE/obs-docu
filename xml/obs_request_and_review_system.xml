 <title>Request And Review System</title>
 <info/>
 <para> The OBS comes with a generic request system where one party can ask
  another to complete a certain action. This can be, for example, taking source
  changes, granting maintainer rights or deleting a package. Requests are also
  used deal with more complex workflows. </para>
 <para> A request is an object in the database. It can be accessed via the
  /request API route. osc and the web interface can show and process these
  requests. There are also interfaces to show the requests which should be
  handled for a certain user. </para>
 <sect1>
  <title>What a request looks like</title>
  <para> A request is an object in the database. It can be accessed via the
   /request API route. Main parts of the request are </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para> state: The state tells if the request still needs to processed
      or has been handled already and how. </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> actions: these are the changes which will be applied when
      accepting the request. </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> reviewer: reviewer can be added automatically at request
      creation time or manually by any involved party. Usually all of them
      should approve the request before it will be accepted. However, the
      target can ignore that and accept anyway optionally. </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> description: an explanation of why the actions should be done.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> history: a history about state changes of the request.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> accept_at: the request will get accepted automatically after the
      given time. Such a request can only be created when having write
      permissions in the target. Automatic cleanup requests created by Admin
      user are using this. </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist> 
   <para>Each request can only be accepted entirely or not at all.
   Therefore it may make sense to have multiple actions in one request if
   changes should be applied in one transaction. For example submitting a new
   package and removing an old instance: Do either both or nothing. This
   implies that the person accepting the request must have write access in all
   targets or they will not be allowed to accept the request. </para>
  <sect2>
   <title>Action types</title>
   <para> Actions always specify some target. This can be either a project or a
    package. Further information depend on the action type. The following gives
    an overview, for details, see the XML schema for requests. </para>
   <sect3>
    <title>Submit</title>
    <para> A submit action will transfer sources from one package to another
     package. Usually a submit request will refer to a specific revision in the
     source, but it does not have to. If no revision is specified, then the
     current revision at the time of acceptance will be used. This should be
     avoided when relying on complex reviews during the request process. Hence,
     it is recommended to identify a specific version in your submitrequest
      (<command>osc submitrequest -r 42 ...</command>). </para>
    <para> The submit action can support options to update the source or even
     to remove the source. Tools like osc are applying the cleanup rule by
     default when submitting from a default user home branch project. </para>
   </sect3>
   <sect3>
    <title>delete</title>
    <para> A delete action can request removal of a project or package
     instance. </para>
   </sect3>
   <sect3>
    <title>add_role</title>
    <para> An add_role requests a specific role for a given user or group to
     the target. For example, one could use this to ask for maintainer rights,
     or to become a default reviewer. </para>
   </sect3>
   <sect3>
    <title>set_bugowner</title>
    <para> set_bugowner is similar to add_role, but removes all other bugowner
     roles in the target. This happens to have a unique identifier to be used
     when assigning bug reports in external tools like Bugzilla. </para>
   </sect3>
   <sect3>
    <title>change_devel</title>
    <para> can be used to update the devel package information in the target.
    </para>
   </sect3>
   <sect3>
    <title>maintenance_incident</title>
    <para> Official request to open a maintenance incident for official support
     products. This create by developers who want to start an official
     maintenance process. Find detail in the maintenance chapter about this. If
     accepted, a new maintenance incident project is created and package
     sources listed are copied there. All sources of all actions in one request
     will be merged into the same maintenance incident. </para>
   </sect3>
   <sect3>
    <title>maintenance_release</title>
    <para> Is used to release a ready maintenance update. Unlike
     maintenance_incident or submit, sources and binaries are copied without a
     rebuild. Details can be found in maintenance chapter. </para>
   </sect3>
   <sect3>
    <title>group</title>
    <para> Deprecated. Was never in a released OBS version. It is not allowed
     to be used anymore. </para>
   </sect3>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
   <title>Request states</title>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para> new: The default value for newly created requests. Everybody
      involved in the specified targets can see the request and accept or
      decline it. </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> accepted: The request has been accepted and the changes applied.
      history files have a reference to this request. </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> declined: The request has been reviewed and not (yet) been
      accepted by the target. This is often used to ask for some more
      information from the submitter, since a declined requests remains an
      active, returning to the submitter's active request queue (i.e. the
      submitter will need to take action now). </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> revoked: The submitter has taken back their request. The request
      is considered to be inactive now. </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> superseded: This request is obsolete due to a new request. The
      request is considered to be inactive now. The superseding request is
      linked in this request. </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> review: There are still open reviews inside of the request.
      Nobody has declined it yet. The request is not yet visible to the target
      by default. The state will change automatically to new when all reviewers
      accept. </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
   <title>Reviewers</title>
   <para> Reviews can be done by users, groups, projects or packages. Review by
    project or package means that any maintainer of them is asked for reviews.
    This is handy to avoid the need to figure who actually is a maintainer of a
    certain package. Also new maintainers of a package will see requests in
    case the old maintainer did not handle them. </para>
   <sect3>
    <title>Manual added reviews</title>
    <para> Reviewers can be added manually by anyone involved in a request.
     This can be used to hand over a review. In that situation the new reviewer
     needs to be added and the own review needs to be accept. The request
     becomes declined when any of the reviewers are declining the request.
    </para>
   </sect3>
   <sect3>
    <title>Automatic added reviews</title>
    <para> Project and package objects can have users or groups with a reviewer
     role. They are added automatically to a request as reviewer when a request
     is created which has them as target. In case the project and package
     bother specify reviewer all of them are added to the request. </para>
   </sect3>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
   <title>Request creation</title>
   <para> The API is doing a number of checks on request creation time. In case
    a target is not specified it tries to set it according to the linked
    package. If an entire project is specified as source it expands it to refer
    all packages inside. This means it is replacing one action with multiple.
    When using the addrevision parameter it does also add the current revision
    of the package source to the action. This makes it easy to create new
    requests with little logic in the client. </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
   <title>Request operations</title>
   <para> Requests can be modified only in very limited ways after creation.
    This is to avoid that reviewers reviewed a request but the nature of the
    requests is changing afterwards. Valid operations on a request are: </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para> diff: does not modify the request, just shows source
      modifications wanted by the request </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> changestate: to change the state of the request, for example to
      accept it. </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> changereviewstate: to change the state of a review inside of a
      request. </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> addreviewer: add further reviewer to a request </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
