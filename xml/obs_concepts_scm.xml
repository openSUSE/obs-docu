 <title>Integrate External Source Repositories</title>

   This chapter makes some recommendations how upstream resources can be
   integrated into the build process. SCM stands for source control management.
   git, subversion or CVS are concrete implementations of a SCM. The OBS itself
   comes also with an own SCM, but this is only intended to manage the files
   needed for packaging. However, you can add references to external SCM
   systems. The source service system will mirror the sources and provide it to
   the build systems. OBS makes sure that you can access the sources of all
   builds also in the future, even when the upstream server delivers different
   or no content at all anymore. Using external SCM references has the
   following advantages:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <simpara>
        It is documented where a source comes from and how to create the archive.

   </listitem>

        Working on the upstream sources can be done directly in local checkouts and changes can be 
        tested via local builds before pushing to the SCM server.

        The sources can be stored incrementally and need less storage on the server.

  <title>Creating a external SCM reference</title>
  <para>
   External refernces are defined in _service files. The file can look like
   this:
<screen>
<![CDATA[
<services>
  <service name="obs_scm">
    <param name="url">git://...</param>
    <param name="scm">git</param>
  </service>
  <service name="tar" mode="buildtime"/>
  <service name="recompress" mode="buildtime">
    <param name="file">*.tar</param>
    <param name="compression">xz</param>
  </service>
  <service name="set_version" mode="buildtime" />
</services>
      ]]>
</screen>
   The services do the following:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      obs_scm: mirrors the source. It stores it as a cpio archive, but for the build process this looks like a directory. It also stores additional information from the metadata to a file with obsinfo suffix.
    </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      tar: creates a tar file from the directory
    </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      recompress: applies a compression on the tar file
    </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      set_version: reads the version from the obsinfo file and adapts the build descriptions to it.
    </simpara>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   Please note that only the first service (obs_scm) runs on the OBS
   server. The other services run during the build process. They can
   also be replaced by any user by providing alternative implementations of
   them, or by writing their own service from scratch.

  <title>Working with local checkouts</title>
  <para>
   Using
<screen>
            osc build
          </screen>
   in any package with such a defintion will do the same process locally. The
   only difference is that you get a local subdirectory with the SCM content.
   You can go inside and work as you are used to. Any changes inside will be
   used for your next local build, whether they were pushed to the upstream
   server or not. However, you need to push it upstream when you let the OBS
   server re-fetch the changes from upstream. The only way out would be to set
   the "obs_scm" service to mode disabled and upload your local archive.
  </para>

  <title>Manage your build description in SCM</title>
  <para>
   The "obs_scm" service allows you to export files next to the archive. You
   can specify one or more files using the "extract" parameter. Use it for your
   build description files.
