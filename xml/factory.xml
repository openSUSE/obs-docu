   The main project is openSUSE:Factory. This project is controlled by a small
   group which does review all submissions according to the policies.
   Submissions are possible via submit requests, which get reviewed by default
   by two groups: The Legal team and the code review team.

  <para>
   The goal of openSUSE:Factory is to always have a working state. This is
   needed to allow all developer groups to use it as a base for testing their
   own, possibly experimental work in their own projects.
