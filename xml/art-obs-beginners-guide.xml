  <title>Target Audience</title>
  <para>
   This document is intended for users and developers interested in
   building packages from source code for different platforms and Linux distributions.
   Basic knowledge of Linux and the command line usage<!--, and package building--> is
   recommended.

  <title>Conceptual Overview</title>
  <para>
   Created in 2005, the &obs; (&obsa;) is a generic system for building and
   distributing packages or images from source code in an automatic, consistent,
   and reproducible way.
   &obsa; can create images and installable packages for a wide range
   of operating systems
   (&suse;, Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Windows, etc.) and hardware architectures
   (&x86;, &amd64;, &zseries;, &ppc; etc.).
  </para>
  <sect2 xml:id="sec-obsbg-concept-pkgspec">
   <title>Build Recipe</title>
   <para>
    To create a package in &obsa;, you need a <firstterm>build recipe</firstterm>

      <title>Requirements</title>
      <para>
       Packages depend on other packages to function properly.
       There are two types of requirements:
       <emphasis>build requirements</emphasis> and
       <emphasis>installation requirements</emphasis>.
      </para>
     </formalpara>
     <para>
      Build requirements are dependencies which are needed during the
      build process in &obsa;. For example, a C++ program needs
      a C++ compiler.
     </para>
     <para>
      Installation requirements are dependencies which are needed when installing
      the final package.

      <title>A Package List</title>
      <para>
       To successfully install and remove a package and all its contents,
       the package manager needs to know which files and directories belong to
       which package.
      </para>
     </formalpara>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    For RPM-based operating systems such as &opensuse;, &sle;, or &rhel;, all
    the information above is included
    in a file with the file extension <filename
     class="extension">.spec</filename>.
   </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 xml:id="sec-obsbg-buildhost">
   <title>Build Hosts and Packages</title>
  <para>
   The &obsa; server provides a Web interface and an API. The API is
   used by the &osccmd; command-line tool.
  </para>
  <para>
   To build the package, the back end creates a sandbox with
   the respective distribution. This sandbox is isolated from
   the rest of the host system.
   Depending on the build recipe (on RPM-based systems, this is a
   <firstterm>spec file</firstterm>), other packages
   are downloaded and installed prior to building.
  </para>
  <para>
   The build process executes all the instructions that it finds in the build
   recipe.
   If the build is successful, the files which belong to the package
   are installed into the sandbox. From those sandboxed files, the final RPM
   package is created and moved into a download area, the
   <emphasis>download repository</emphasis>.
  </para>
  <para>
    End users can install the package using their preferred package management
    tools. On a &suse;-based system, you can use &yast; or Zypper command-line
    tool to install an RPM version of the package.
  </para>
  <para>
   Other &obsa;-related services (like the notification server, mirror
   interface, etc.) perform very specific tasks and therefore beyond the
   scope of this guide.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-obsbg-project">
   <title>Projects and Packages</title>
   <para>
    In &obsa;, packages are organized in <emphasis>projects</emphasis>.
    A single project can contain several packages, and it usually serves a specific
    organizational purpose. Generic access control, related repositories, and
    build targets (operating systems and architectures) are all defined on
    the project level.
   </para>
   <para>
    Projects can also have other projects (subprojects) to structure work.
    They are isolated from their parent project and can be configured
    individually.
   </para>
   <para>
    Each project name is separated by colon.
    For example, in the &osbs;, packages for fonts are
    collected in the project
    <uri>M17N:fonts</uri> which is a subproject of <uri>M17N</uri>.
    Packages for the Python programming
    language are available in the <uri>devel:languages:python</uri> project
    which is a subproject of <uri>devel:languages</uri> which itself is a
    subproject of <uri>devel</uri>.
   </para>
   <para>
    As a user, you will normally build packages in your
    <firstterm baseform="Home Project">home project</firstterm>, available
    in &obsa; as <uri>home:<replaceable>USERNAME</replaceable></uri>.
    Home projects serve as a personal working area in &obsa; to define build
    targets, upload, build, and download packages. Users are also permitted
    to create subprojects for temporary subprojects to work on other people's packages.
   </para>
   <para>
    Sometimes, you will see the <uri>obs://<replaceable
     >DOMAIN</replaceable>/<replaceable>PROJECT</replaceable></uri>
    notation. The <uri>obs://</uri> schema is a shorthand to abbreviate the
    long URL and needs to be replaced by the real &obsa; instance URL.

  <title>Installing Packages from &obsa;</title>
  <para>
   &obsa; provides a place containing all the distribution-specific and
   architecture-specific versions
   of successfully built packages. When you create a package
   in your &obsa; home project, all successfully built packages appear
   under the <uri>&obsdnlurlhome1;</uri> URL.
  </para>
  <para>
   However, this is only true for the home project itself and manually created
   subprojects, but not for subprojects created as a result of branching a
   package. Branched projects are not published by default.
   If you need the build results, download the binaries manually with
   <command>osc getbinaries</command>.
  </para>
  <para>
   For example, if you have enabled the &tw; distribution,
   all packages for &tw; will be published at
   <uri>&obsdnlurlhome1;/openSUSE_Tumbleweed</uri>. This <emphasis>download
   repository</emphasis> is used as an installation source for Zypper or &yast;.
  </para>
  <para>To install the <package>&gitproject;</package> package from your home project,
  use the following steps:</para>
  <procedure>
   <step xml:id="st.obsbg.uc.install-from-obs.repourls">
    <para>Inside your working directory, determine the download repository
     URLs:</para>

   To update the package again, run <xref linkend="st-obsbg-install"/>.
   You do not need to execute
