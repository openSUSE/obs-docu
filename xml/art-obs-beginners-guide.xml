  <title>Target Audience</title>
  <para>
   This document is intended for interested users and developers who want to
   build packages from source code for different distributions.
   Basic knowledge of Linux and usage of the command line<!--, and package building--> is
   recommended.

  <title>Conceptual Overview</title>
  <para>
   Created in 2005, the &obs; (&obsa;) is a generic system to build and
   distribute packages or images from source code in an automatic, consistent
   and reproducible way.
   &obsa; can create images and installable packages for a wide range
   of operating systems
   (&suse;, Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat, Windows, etc.) and hardware architectures
   (&x86;, &amd64;, &zseries;, &ppc; etc.).
  </para>
  <sect2 xml:id="sec.obsbg.concept.pkgspec">
   <title>Package Specification</title>
   <para>To create a package in &obsa;, you need a <firstterm>package specification</firstterm>

      <title>Requirements</title>
      <para>
       Packages depend on other packages to function properly.
       There are two types of requirements:
       <emphasis>build requirements</emphasis> and
       <emphasis>installation requirements</emphasis>.
      </para>
     </formalpara>
     <para>
      Build requirements are dependencies which are needed during the
      build process in &obsa;. For example, a C++ program needs
      a C++ compiler.
     </para>
     <para>
      Installation requirements are dependencies which are needed when installing
      the final package.
     </para>

     <formalpara>
      <title>A Package List</title>
      <para>
       To successfully install and remove a package with all its contents,
       the package manager needs to know which files and directories belong to
       which package.
      </para>
     </formalpara>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    For RPM-based operating systems such as &opensuse;, &sle;, or &rhel;, all
    the information above is included
    in a file with the file extension <filename
     class="extension">.spec</filename>.
   </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 xml:id="sec.obsbg.buildhost">
   <title>Build Hosts and Packages</title>
  <para>
   The &obsa; server provides a Web interface and an API. The API is
   used by the &osccmd; command line tool.
  </para>
  <para>
   To build the package, the back-end creates a sandbox with
   the respective distribution on demand. This sandbox is isolated from
   the rest of the host system.
   Depending on the &packspec; (on RPM-based systems, this is a
   <firstterm>spec file</firstterm>), other packages
   are downloaded and installed prior to building.
  </para>
  <para>
   The build process itself executes all the instructions inside the &packspec;.
   If the build is successful, the files which belong to the package
   are installed into the sandbox. From those sandboxed files, the final RPM
   package is created and moved into a download area (the
   <emphasis>download repository</emphasis>).
  </para>
  <para>
   The package is then publicly available and can be installed. In the case
   of an RPM package for a &suse;-based system, you would use &yast; or
   Zypper as the installation tool.
  </para>
  <para>
   Other services around &obsa; (like the notification server, mirror
   interface etc.) are relatively specific in purpose and therefore of lesser
   importance for this guide.

   <title>Projects and Packages</title>
   <para>
    In &obsa;, packages are organized in <emphasis>projects</emphasis>.
    A single project can contain several packages and usually serves a specific
    organizational purpose. Generic access control, related repositories, and
    build targets (operating systems and architectures) are all defined at
    the project level.
   </para>
   <para>
    Projects can also have other projects (subprojects) to structure work.
    They are isolated from their parents project and can be configured
    independently.
   </para>
   <para>
    Each project name is separated by colons.
    For example, in the &opensuse; Build Service, packages for fonts are
    collected in the project
    <uri>M17N:fonts</uri> which is a subproject of <uri>M17N</uri>.
    Packages for the Python programming
    language are available in the <uri>devel:languages:python</uri> project
    which is a subproject of <uri>devel:languages</uri> which itself is a
    subproject of <uri>devel</uri>.
   </para>

    As a user, you will normally build packages in your
    <firstterm baseform="Home Project">home project</firstterm>, available
    in &obsa; as <uri>home:<replaceable>USERNAME</replaceable></uri>.
    Home projects serve as a personal working area in &obsa; to define build
    targets, upload, build, and download packages. Users are also permitted
    to create subprojects f 
    temporary
    subprojects to work on other people's packages. 
   </para>
   <para>
    Sometimes, you will see the <uri>obs://<replaceable
     >DOMAIN</replaceable>/<replaceable>PROJECT</replaceable></uri>
    notation. The <uri>obs://</uri> schema is a shorthand to abbreviate the
    long URL and needs to be replaced by the real &obsa; instance URL.

   in your &obsa; home project, all successfully built packages will appear
   under the <uri>&obsdnlurlhome1;</uri> URL.
  </para>
  <para>
   However, this is only true for the home project itself and manually created
   subprojects but not for subprojects created as a result of branching a
   package. Branched projects are not published by default.
   If you need the build results though, download the binaries manually with
   <command>osc getbinaries</command>.

  <para>
   For example, if you have enabled the &tw; distribution,
   all packages for Tumbleweed will appear under the URL
   <uri>&obsdnlurlhome1;/openSUSE_Tumbleweed</uri>. This <emphasis>download
   repository</emphasis> is used as an installation source for Zypper or &yast;.
  </para>
  <para>To install the <package>&gitproject;</package> package from your home project,
  use the following steps:</para>

   To update the package again, only run <xref linkend="st.obsbg.install"/>.
   You do not need to execute
   <xref linkend="st.obsbg.uc.install-from-obs.repourls"/> again, as the
   repository is already configured in your system.
