  <title>Conceptual Overview</title>
  <para>
   Created in 2005, the &obs; (&obsa;) is a generic system to build and
   distribute packages or images from source code in an automatic, consistent
   and reproducible way.
   &obsa; is able to create images and installable packages for a wide range
   of operating systems
   (&suse;, Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat, Windows, etc.) and hardware architectures
   (&x86;, &amd64;, &zseries;, &ppc; etc.).
  </para>

      <title>Requirements</title>
      <para>
       Packages depend on other packages to function properly.
       Requirements are distinguished between <emphasis>build requirements</emphasis>
       and <emphasis>install requirements</emphasis>.
       Build requirements are dependencies which are needed before the
       build process starts in &obsa;. For example, a C++ program needs
       a C++ compiler.
       Install requirements are dependencies which are used later when the
       package is finished and ready to be installed.

      <title>A Package List</title>
      <para>
       To successfully install and remove a package with all the contents,
       the package manager needs to know which files and directories belong to
       which package.
      </para>
     </formalpara>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    For RPM-based systems like &suse;, all the information above is included
    in a file with the file extension <filename
     class="extension">.spec</filename>.

   <title>Build Hosts and Packages</title>
  <para>
   The &obs; can communicate either through a Web interface or a command
   line interface. Both access the OBS API which controls the database,
   the search engine, and more. The OBS API communicates also indirectly with
   the backend which provides a storage pool and the build hosts.
  </para>
  <para>
   To build the package, the backend creates a <quote>sandbox</quote> of
   the respective distribution on demand. This sandbox is isolated from
   the rest of the host system.
   Depending on the package specification (the so called
   <firstterm>spec file</firstterm> on RPM-based systems), other packages
   are downloaded and installed prior to building.
  </para>
  <para>
   The build process itself executes all the instructions inside the spec
   file. If the build was successful, the files which belongs to the package
   are installed in the sandbox and the final RPM package is created and
   moved into a download area (the <quote>download repository</quote>).
   This makes the package publicly available and can installed with &yast;
   or zypper.
  </para>
  <para>
   Other services around &obsa; (like the notification server, mirror
   interface etc.) has specific purpose which is of less importance for
   this guide.

   <title>Projects and Packages</title>
   <para>
    In &obsa;, packages are organized in <emphasis>projects</emphasis>.
    A single project can contain several different packages and serves a specific
    purpose, defines access control, other repositories, and build targets
    (operating systems and architectures).
   </para>
   <para>
    Projects can also contain other projects (subprojects) to structure work.
    Each project name is separated by colons.
    For example, all packages for fonts are collected in the project
    <uri>M17N:fonts</uri> and all relevant packages for the Python programming
    language are available in the <uri>devel:languages:python</uri> project.
   </para>
   <para>
    As a user, you will build your packages normally in your
    <firstterm baseform="Home Project">home project</firstterm>, available
    in &obsa; as <uri>home:<replaceable>USERNAME</replaceable></uri>.
    The home project is your working area in OBS for defining build targets,
    uploading and building packages, and installing the results with Zypper
    or &yast;.
   </para>
   <para>
    Sometimes you see the <uri>obs://<replaceable>PROJECT</replaceable></uri>
    notation. The <uri>obs://</uri> schema is a shorthand to abbreviate the
    long URL and needs to be replaced by the real &obsa; instance URL.
